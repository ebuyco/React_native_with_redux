JavaScript and React. Importantly, the interfaces we build are translated into native views. React Native apps are not composed of WebViews. Weâ€™ll be able to share a lot of the code we write between iOS and Android. And React Native makes it easy to write code specific to each platform when the need arises. We get to use one language (JavaScript), one framework (React), one styling engine, and one toolchain to write apps for both platforms. Learn once, write anywhere. At its core, React Native is composed of React components.
